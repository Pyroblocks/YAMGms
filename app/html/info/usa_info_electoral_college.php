	<p>
		The Electoral College is the process in which the United States elects its president. Each state (Including the District of Columbia) is allocated a number of electors equal to its number of representatives plus two for each of its senators.
	</p>
	<p>
		To win the presidency, a candidate must win a majority of all electors. Most states have a "winner-take-all" system, where the candidate who wins the popular vote in the state, wins all of its electors. States such as Nebraska and Maine use a proportional system to allocate its electors.
